#bash-config
My personal bash configuration

##What's included
bash-aliases file
profile file

If you want to reload it each time you run 
source ~/.bashrc or . ~/.bashrc
you must include in your .bashrc file the following:


	$ if [ -f ~/bash-config/.bash_aliases ]; then
      . ~/bash-config/.bash_aliases
      fi
